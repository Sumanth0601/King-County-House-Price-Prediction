# King County House Price Prediction
Predict King County house prices with data analysis and machine learning, aiding real estate decisions.

## Overview

This GitHub project is dedicated to predicting house prices in King County, Washington, using a variety of machine learning techniques. Predicting house prices is a valuable task for both buyers and sellers, and this project aims to showcase the development and evaluation of predictive models for this purpose.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: The project begins by loading the King County housing dataset and converting it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extensive exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset, including data distribution, correlations, and identification of missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations of data patterns and relationships are created using various plots, such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
- **Model Building**: The project builds a predictive model using a TensorFlow Sequential neural network with multiple layers.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).
- **Visualization**: Visualizations are included to compare actual house prices with predicted prices.
